94. Visceral surface of posterior median dorsal plate: anterior margin narrower than exposed constricted posterior region (0); anterior margin as wide as or wider than exposed constricted posterior region (1).
> Newly added by Yan, to distinguish two species of *Xichonolepis*.

> - The coding of *Xichonolepis qujingensis* is 1.
> - The coding of *Xichonolepis wudingensis* is 0.

97. Size of dorsal articular depression for the dermal process of pectoral appendage: short (0), long (1).
> - Newly added by Yan, to distinguish sinolepids from euantiarchs.
> - This character is relative to Character 88.

98. Size of ventral articular depression for the dermal process of pectoral appendage: short (0), long (1).
> - Newly added by Yan, to distinguish sinolepids from euantiarchs.
> - This character is relative to Character 88.

99. Obtected nuchal area: small (0); large (1).

103. Composition of doral median spine: AMD plate (0); AMD and PMD plates (1).
> Newly added.

104. Flat trunk shield: absence (0), presence (1).

> - We define the ratio of the height of trunk shield relative to the length of trunk shield ventral walll less than **0.2?** as the flat trunk shield. Considering the varablity of the posterior process of posterior median dorsal wall, We use the length of trunk shield ventral wall rather than the length of the trunk shield dorsal wall as the reference to define the relative height of trunk shield.

> - The flat trunk shield is present in sinolepids, **to be checked one by one.**
