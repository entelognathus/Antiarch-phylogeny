> - Antiarchs have foramen axillare and funnel pit of processus brachialis but no processus brachialis were coded as "simple" states (e.g., Sinolepidae), primitive articulations (e.g., *Yunnanolepis*) were identified as brachial process "absent" in the previous Character. 

82. Axillary foramen: small (0); large (1).

> Young (1984, 1988), Character 27; Zhang and Young (1992), Character 15; Zhu (1996), Character 4; Jia, Zhu & Zhao (2010), Character 32; Pan et al. (2017), Character 4; Wang & Zhu (2018), Character 74.

>- We followed Young (1988) and identified the axillary foramen larger than 30% of the lateral lamina of AVL as large axillary foramen. Young regarded the large axillary foramen is a synapomorphy of Bothriolepididae, which may be doubtful. More researchers suggested it reflects a strong muscle and improved movement capacity of fin, and is apomorphic whatever its function.

83. Pectoral appendage: unjointed (0); jointed (1).

84. Dorsal central plate 1 and dorsal central plate 2 of pectoral appendage: in contact (0); separated (1).

88.	Lateral position of infraorbital sensory canal on paranuchal and lateral plate, forming narrow lateral divisions: absent (0); present (1).

> Retchie et al. (1992, Character 1)

> - Present in *Sinolepis* and *Grenfellaspis*. Check the condition in other antiarchs.

89.	Broad anterior margin of anterior median dorsal plate: absent (0); present (1).

> Retchie et al. (1992, Character 2)

> - Present in *Sinolepis* and *Grenfellaspis*. However, the definition of this character is subjective. It is redundant with the character “Index r1 between width of anterior margin and maximum width of anterior median dorsal plate (ordered): r1>55 (0); 35=<r1=<55 (1); 15=<r1<35 (2); <15 (3).”

90.	Short posterolateral margin of anterior median dorsal plate: absent (0); present (1).

> Retchie et al. (1992, Character 3)

> - Present in *Sinolepis* and *Grenfellaspis*. However, the definition of this character is subjective. It is redundant with the character “Index r2 between anterior and posterior divisions of anterior median dorsal plate (ordered): r2<300 (0); 300<=r2=<500 (1); r2>500 (2).”

91.	Square shaped of posterior median dorsal plate, with reduced lateral processes: absent (0); present (1).

> Retchie et al. (1992, Character 4)

> - Present in *Sinolepis* and *Grenfellaspis*. Check whether it is redundant with the character "Lateral process of posterior median dorsal plate: conspicuous (0); reduced (1).".

92.	Dorsal central plate 1 and ventral central plate 1 have large semicircular articular areas, similar in size and closely integrated to ornamented part of bone: absent (0); present (1).

> Retchie et al. (1992, Character 6)

> - Retchie et al. (1992) regarded it is a synapomorphy of Bothriolepidoids and Asterolepidoids.

93.	Mesial lamina on dorsal central plate 1: absent (0); present (1).

> Retchie et al. (1992, Character 7)

> - Few researchers have noticed that character, Retchie regarded it is a synapomorphy of Bothriolepidoids and Asterolepidoids.

94.	Mesial marginal plate 1 restricted to mesial wall of pectoral fin: absent (0); present (1).

> Retchie et al. (1992, Character 8)

> - Mesial marginal plate 1 enclosed by dorsal/ventral central plate 1 and mesial marginal plate 2 on visceral view.

95. Nerves and vessels to pectoral fin passing through a single axillary foramen: absent (0); present (1).

> Retchie et al. (1992), Character 11.

> - Retchie et al. (1992) regarded it is a synapomorphy of sinolepids and euantiarchs.
