>- We followed Young (1988) and identified the axillary foramen larger than 30% of the lateral lamina of AVL as large axillary foramen. Young regarded the large axillary foramen is a synapomorphy of Bothriolepididae, which may be doubtful.

82.	Position of postmarginal plate relative to paranuchal plate: anterolateral of paranuchal plate (0); posterolateral of paranuchal plate (1)
> - Some antiarchs like *Bothriolepis* and *Dianolepis* have the postmarginal plate anterolateral of paranuchal plate; others like *Microbrachius* has the postmarginal plate posterolateral of paranuchal plate (see Moloshnikov, 2011; Fig. 7).

83.	Postmarginal canal: absent (0); present (1).
